        <script>

            let numInput = 6;
            let stringInput = "hello World!"

            function add7(){
                return numInput + 7;
            }

            function multiply7(){
                return numInput * 7;
            }

            function capitalize(){
                return stringInput[0].toUpperCase() + stringInput.slice(1);
            }
            //Struggled a little with this one, but the square brackets replaced charAt, which chooses which character the upper case is being applied to, the + stringInput.slice(1) is used to remove the original, lowercase letter that we've now capitalised

            function lastLetter(){
                return stringInput.slice(-1);
            }
            //Using slice(-1) means that you don't have to count the amount of characters in the string so you can use charAt which was my first instinct. Using a negative means the position is counted from the end of the string and there is no -0.
